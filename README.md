# Hello! Welcome to Alien Invasion game. :milky_way: 

This game was inspired by the [Python Crash Course](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_3e) by Eric Matthes.  

I added several new features, such as:  
- A **rain of monsters** 🌧️👾  
- Improved interface and levels  
- A **JSON file** to store your high score (encrypted on your PC)  
  - Saved in Documents on Windows  
  - Saved in Home on Linux  
- Classic **sound effects** originally from Taito (1978) 🔊
